# Solid-Principles

This project demonstrates the **SOLID** principles in C# using simple console-based examples.  
Each principle is implemented in a separate folder with real-world scenarios to showcase what happens if the principle is violated and how to overcome it.  

## SOLID Principles:
- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
- **O**: Open-Closed Principle (OCP)  
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
